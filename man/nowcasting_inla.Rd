}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{Dataset with at least 3 columns, date of onset, date of report and stratum.}

\item{bins_age}{Age bins to do the nowcasting, it receive a vector of age bins,
or options between, "SI-PNI", "10 years", "5 years".
\link{Default} "SI-PNI".}

\item{trim.data}{(in days) Date to be trimmed out from the data base, in days.

\link{Default} 0 days.}

\item{Dmax}{(in weeks) Until which maximum amount of weeks the Nowcasting will use for the estimation.
\link{Default} 15 weeks.}

\item{wdw}{(in weeks) Window of dates the estimation will act, i.e., how many past weeks the nowcasting will estimates.
\link{Default} 30 weeks.}

\item{age_col}{Column for ages}

\item{data.by.week}{If it has to be returned the whole time-series data.
\link{Default} FALSE.}

\item{return.age}{If the estimate by Age should be returned.
\link{Default} TRUE.}

\item{silent}{\link{Depracted} Should be the warnings turned off?
\link{Default} is TRUE.}

\item{K}{How much weeks to forecast ahead?
\link{Default} K is 0, no forecasting ahead}

\item{...}{}
}
\value{
a list of 2 elements, each element with a data.frame with nowcasting estimation, $\link{1} 'Total', $\link{2} by 'Age'.
If data.by.week = TRUE, add a $\link{3} 'dados' with the time-series out of wdw.
}
\description{
function to estimate amount of events already started by not yet notified.
The main use is to estimate how many cases in a outbreak has already started their onset date of symptons
but has not yet notified.
nowcasting_inla, fits a statistical distribution to the empirical distribution of time of delay between
onset date and report date.
