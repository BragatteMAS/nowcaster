\title{nowcasting_inla, function to estimate amount of events already started by not yet notified.
The main use is to estimate how many cases in a outbreak has already started their onset date of symptons but has not yet notified.
nowcasting_inla, fits a statistical distribution to the empirical distribution of time of delay between onset date and report date.}
\usage{
nowcasting_inla(
  dataset,
  bins_age = "SI-PNI",
  trim.data,
  Dmax = 15,
  wdw = 30,
  data.by.week = FALSE,
  return.age = T,
  silent = F,
  K = 0,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{Dataset with at least 3 columns, date of onset, date of report and stratum.}

\item{bins_age}{\link{Optinal} Age bins to do the nowcasting, it receive a vector of age bins,
or options between, "SI-PNI", "10 years", "5 years". \link{Default} "SI-PNI".}

\item{trim.data}{(in days) Date to be trimmed out from the data base, in days. Default 0 days.}

\item{Dmax}{(in weeks) Until which maximum amount of weeks the Nowcasting will use for the estimation. \link{Default} 15 weeks.}

\item{wdw}{(in weeks) Window of dates the estimation will act, i.e., how many past weeks the nowcasting will estimates.\link{Default} 30 weeks.}

\item{data.by.week}{\link{Optinal} If it has to be returned the whole time-series data. \link{Default} FALSE.}

\item{return.age}{\link{Optinal} If the estimate by Age should be returned. \link{Default} TRUE.}

\item{silent}{\link{Optinal} Should be the warnings turned off? \link{Default} is TRUE.}

\item{K}{\link{Optinal} How much weeks to forecast ahead? \link{Default} K is 0, no forecasting ahead}

\item{...}{#' The estimation for the total is done by taking the age estimation all together.}
}
\value{
a list of 2 elements, each element with a data.frame with nowcasting estimation, $\link{1} 'Total', $\link{2} by 'Age'.
If data.by.week = TRUE, add a $\link{3} 'dados' with the time-series out of wdw.
