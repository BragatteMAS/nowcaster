## Loading Nowcasters

Loading necessary packages:

```{r libraries}
library(devtools)
library(roxygen2)
```

Loading the nowcaster R package:

```{r load-all}
library(nowcaster)
```

Loading the data from Belo Horizonte city:

```{r data-bh}
data<-sragBH
```

And we take a look on the data:

```{r lookup}
head(data)
```

It is a data.frame with 7 variables and 65,404 observations. We will make use of only the first two columns, "DT_SIN_PRI" and "DT_DIGITA" as well the column "Idade" to make age structured nowcasting.

```{r nowcasting}
nowcasting_bh<-nowcasting_inla(dataset = data, 
                               bins_age = "10 years", 
                               data.by.week = T, 
                               return.age = T, 
                               age_col = Idade)
```
